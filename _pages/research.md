I conduct research on natural language meaning. To investigate how meaning arises from the complex expressions that speakers utter and how listeners understand what speakers intend to communicate, I make use of methods and models from theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics and computational linguistics.

## Methods

I collect data through a variety of methods: 

* one-on-one elicitation with native speakers, including ''in the field'', i.e., in places like Mexico or Paraguay,
* production and comprehension experiments, in the laboratory, in the field or via the internet, and
* data mining from corpora, i.e., large collections of naturally occurring texts.

## Languages

To understand the nature and limits of cross-linguistic variation in natural language meaning, it is vital to investigate not just well-studied European languages, like English, but also others of the over 6,000 languages that are still spoken today. In addition to English, I have worked on several languages that are under-represented in linguistic research, such as Yukatek, a Mayan language spoken in Mexico, and Paraguayan Guaraní, a Tupí-Guaraní language spoken in Paraguay. Together with collaborators, I have also investigated topics in K'iche' (Mayan), Tagalog (Austronesian), Bulgarian (Slavic) and Bulu (Bantu), just to name a few.

## Current research areas

### Projective content

When listeners infer that speakers are committed to utterance content that is contributed by expressions realized in the scope of an entailment-canceling operator, we say that that content projects. My research investigates the information sources listeners rely on in deriving inferences about speaker commitment and how such information is integrated, as illustrated in my [SALT 30 keynote](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/guyt25gl8luvok2/AABi7n62L2uHMbirR8SC7fzoa?dl=0) from August 2020, which is based on joint work with [Judith Degen](https://sites.google.com/site/judithdegen/). Some recent papers investigate [projection variability in Paraguayan Guaraní](http://judith-tonhauser.github.io/files/tonhauser-NLLT-preprint.pdf) (<i>Natural Language and Linguistic Theory</i>), [projection variability in English](http://judith-tonhauser.github.io/files/deMarneffe-etal-SuB2019.pdf) (<i>Sinn und Bedeutung</i>) and [the relation between projection and at-issueness](https://doi.org/10.1093/jos/ffy007) (<i>Journal of Semantics</i>).

### Prosody

Utterance meaning is contributed not just by the expressions uttered but also by <i>how</i> a speaker produces the expressions uttered, including the relative prominences and groupings of the words and the tonal movements. My research to date has investigated the prosody of focus in a variety of languages, including [Paraguayan Guaraní](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1086/669629) as well as [K'iche and Moroccan Arabic](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23273798.2015.1071856?journalCode=plcp21). In an ongoing project, [https://u.osu.edu/deo.13/](Ashwini Deo) and I are investigating the prosody of focus in Marathi, Gujarati and Chodri, three South Asian languages. I am particularly interested in the contribution prosody makes to pragmatic phenomena, like [conversational implicatures](http://judith-tonhauser.github.io/files/deMarneffe-Tonhauser-QiD.pdf) and [presupposition projection](http://judith-tonhauser.github.io/files/tonhauser-etal-SuB-2019.pdf).
