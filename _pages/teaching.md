I am honored to have been nominated for the [Lehrepreis](https://stuvus.uni-stuttgart.de/lehrepreis/) of the University of Stuttgart in 2020 and 2024.

### Bachelor and Master theses

I advise theses on topics in semantics, pragmatics, psycholinguistics, prosody and on social meaning. To write a thesis with me, you should ideally have taken at least one course with me so that your thesis can build on the course content. 

These [guidelines](https://github.com/judith-tonhauser/teaching-materials/blob/master/6_paper-and-thesis-guidelines.pdf) (which are frequently updated) provide information on my expectations regarding the content, organization and mechanics of theses (and term papers) as well as on how I grade theses (and term papers). Please review them carefully if you are thinking of writing a thesis with me. I also go over these guidelines in courses that require a term paper.

You are welcome to develop a research question for your thesis based on your background and interests, as long as I feel comfortable advising a thesis on that topic, but I am also happy to suggest a research question. I generally expect both Bachelor and Master theses to include an original research component, which means that you will collect and analyze production or comprehension data to investigate the research question addressed in your thesis. Theses that investigate the state of the art on a particular research topic  include a research proposal.
