This page provides information on my courses at the University of Stuttgart as well as on the Bachelor and Master theses I advise.

* Research colloquium in syntax, semantics and pragmatics (every semester since WiSe 2018/19, joint with Prof. Dr. Daniel Hole)

### Bachelor and Master theses

I advise theses on topics in semantics and pragmatics and on social meaning. To write a thesis with me, you will ideally have taken at least one course with me so that your thesis can build on the course content. 

These [guidelines](https://github.com/judith-tonhauser/teaching-materials/blob/master/6_paper-and-thesis-guidelines.pdf) provide information on my expectations regarding the content, organization and mechanics of theses (and term papers) as well as on how I grade theses (and term papers). Please review them carefully if you are thinking of writing a thesis with me (I also go over these guidelines in courses that require a term paper).

You are welcome to develop a research question for your thesis based on your own interests (as long as I feel comfortable advising a thesis on that topic). I generally expect both Bachelor and Master theses to include an original research component, which means that you will collect and analyze production or comprehension data to investigate the research question addressed in your thesis.

Here are the titles of theses I have advised at the University of Stuttgart:

* Modification with <i>falsely</i>: Evidence for entailment relations
* The variable (ING): A case study of Michelle Obama
