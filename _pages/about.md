I am a full professor in the [Department of English Linguistics](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/ifla/) at the University of Stuttgart, as well as the chair of the department.

I conduct research on meaning: how does the meaning of a speaker's utterance arise from the complex interplay of the meanings of the uttered expressions, the discourse context and the interlocutors' mental states, and how do listeners comprehend speakers' utterances?


My research program in theoretical semantics and pragmatics investigates and formally models how natural lan- guage meaning arises from the complex interplay of conventionally coded content, discourse context and interlocu- tors’ mental states, as well as how languages vary in this regard. I address these questions through research on a broad range of core phenomena, including presuppositions, information structure and reference, in English as well as in languages that are under-represented in linguistic research, such as Paraguayan Guaran ́ı, a Tup ́ı-Guaran ́ı lan- guage. By applying corpus-linguistic methods and collecting data in experiments and fieldwork with theoretically untrained speakers, my research promotes an empirically sound foundation for investigations of natural language meaning.

Over the past two decades, my research has benefited from interdisciplinary collaborations with phoneticians, computational linguists, sociolinguists and psycholinguists. I am inspired by the guiding principle of the Stuttgarter Weg and see tremendous opportunities at the University of Stuttgart for collaborative projects with colleagues in theoretical, computational and psycho-linguistics, in the digital humanities as well as in literature. In this document, I provide information on ongoing research projects (section 1) and then turn to outlining funding I intend to apply for (section 2) and how my research connects with research at the University of Stuttgart (section 3).
