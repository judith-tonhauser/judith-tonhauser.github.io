I am a full professor in the [Department of English Linguistics](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/ifla/) at the University of Stuttgart, as well as the chair of the department.

My research investigates natural language meaning, including semantics and pragmatics. I primarily conduct research on English and Paraguayan Guaraní, a Tupí-Guaraní language spoken in Paraguay and surrounding countries. You can find out more about my research [here](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/research/).
