I am a full professor in the [Department of English Linguistics](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/ifla/) at the University of Stuttgart, as well as the chair of the department. I am also the executive director of the [Institute of Linguistics](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/en/).

My research interests lie in the area of natural language meaning, including both semantics and pragmatics: how does meaning arise from the complex expressions that speakers utter and how do listeners understand what speakers intended to communicate? I primarily conduct research on English and Paraguayan Guaraní, a Tupí-Guaraní language spoken in Paraguay. Find out more about [my research](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/research/) or check out [my publications](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/publications/).

At the University of Stuttgart, I teach [courses](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/teaching/) related to my research interests: introductions to semantics/pragmatics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics, as well as advanced courses in semantics and pragmatics and on social meaning. I also [advise theses](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/teaching/) in these areas. Information about my office hours can be found on my [department webpage](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Tonhauser/).

I also contribute to the University of Stuttgart in the following capacities:
* Committee member, [Verantwortung in der Forschung (Ethikkommission)](https://www.beschaeftigte.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/beratung-und-abwicklung/kommission-verantwortung-in-der-forschung/) 
* Mentor, [AdvanceScience for Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.gradus.uni-stuttgart.de/mentoring/)
* Mentor, [LiveScience for Juniorprofessors](https://www.gradus.uni-stuttgart.de/mentoring/)
