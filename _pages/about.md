I am a full professor in the [Department of English Linguistics](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/ifla/) at the University of Stuttgart, as well as the chair of the department.

I conduct research on natural language meaning: how does meaning arise from the complex expressions that speakers utter and how do listeners understand what speakers intend to communicate? I primarily conduct research on English and Paraguayan Guaraní, a Tupí-Guaraní language spoken in Paraguay and surrounding countries. You can find out more about my research [here](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/research/) or check out my [publications](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/publications/).
