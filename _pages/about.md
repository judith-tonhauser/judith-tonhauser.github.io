I am a full professor in the [Department of English Linguistics](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/ifla/) at the University of Stuttgart. I also currently serve as the [Vice Rector for Early Career Researchers and Diversity of the University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/university/organization/management/).

My research interests lie in the area of natural language meaning, including both semantics and pragmatics: how does meaning arise from the complex expressions that speakers utter and how do listeners understand what speakers intended to communicate? I primarily conduct research on English and Paraguayan Guaraní, a Tupí-Guaraní language spoken in Paraguay. Find out more about [my research](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/research/) or check out [my publications](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/pubs-by-year/).

My research on reasoning-based analyses of presuppositions is currently funded by the [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (project number 566780232)](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/566780232).

At the University of Stuttgart, I teach [courses](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/teaching/) related to my research interests: introductions to semantics/pragmatics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics, as well as advanced courses in semantics and pragmatics and on social meaning. I also [advise theses](https://judith-tonhauser.github.io/teaching/) in these areas. Information about my office hours can be found on my [department webpage](https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Tonhauser/).
